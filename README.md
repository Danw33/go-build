# Multi-Project Build Tool

The multi-project build tool can compile multiple branches of multiple projects to give per-branch and per-project viewable artifacts.

This is ideal when working with many branches or repositories, as it allows easy publication or viewing of the compiled projects for testing and demonstration.

The tool can be used in combination with CI systems such as Travis and Jenkins.
